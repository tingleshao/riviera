# experiments:
# 1. Compare with JPEG: for different quantization size, what is the image quality, compare it with JPEG - with PNAS
#     - different curves represent different data?
# 2. Compare different length vs image quality (assume no packet loss) - with PNAS
#    - also make a plot, assume fixed packet loss (maybe) - wiht PNAS
# 3. Compare different byte format vs image quality (assume no packet loss) - with PNAS
#    - also make a plot, assume fixed packet loss - with PNAS
# 4. Compare different packet strategy. (none vs pnas+repeating + simple repeating)

# todo this, we need:
# all images compressed with all models, with intermediate embedding as the output
# pns each group (grouped by data & embedding size) and save the result
# measure data storage requirement, image quality
# save the result images
